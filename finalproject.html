              <h3>Final Project Idea</h3>
              <p>
                For my final project, I am thinking of making a little robot that holds a medicine bottle and reminds you to take your medicine. In my mind I imagine it as the functionality of an Amazon Echo that talks to you, but I am not really sure about what it will take for one to talk to it, like to ask the question "have I taken my medicine today?" and it being able to respond based on some internal clock/memory. Another functionality that I think of is the little trick robot, the Anki Vector, as a little robot buddy.

                I am thinking that the robot will be a tall box, and will have someway of opening its "stomach" which will be where the medicine bottle would be held. Then the arms that are holding the medicine bottom inside would move out to allow people to grab the bottle. There would have to be a sensor somewhere to let the robot know that if the bottle is put back in its arms, it can put it back in its "stomach".
