                My name is Kassia Love and I am a senior in Currier joint concentrating in Biomedical Engineering and Neuroscience, with a secondary in East Asian Studies. I have a big passion for learning and very interested in different aspects of engineering design. I like to try very fun and challengeing things in effort to learn something new. I am taking this course to learn more in depth the aspects of digital fabrication and engineering design. I like the challenge and puzzle that comes with fabrication and how that can lead to something really big that has some sort of impact on other people's lives, or something really small that you are proud of just because you made it.

                When I am not busy, I am playing percussion with the Harvard marching band and wind ensemble.
